# Bootcamp1707
Git repo for 2017 July London Bootcamp

Four teams were formed:  

* Team OrangeLions
* Team GAMBS
* Team DataBigBig
* Team Rockers

Each team in this bootcamp has their own folder. All of you should be able to modify and commit to this folder once I have all your github IDs entered. Your first goal will be to modify the README.md file for your team folder to have your team member names. 

Eventually, Carl will upload photos of all the team members to your team folders. Your job will be to modify your README to add the photo and captions identifying everyone in your teams. You'll also eventually be putting all your project materials into this repo.
